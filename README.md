## üß† Current Focus

I‚Äôm currently focused on **Dynamic Programming (DP)** ‚Äî it's tough, but I know consistent effort and practice are the key to mastering it. I‚Äôm solving problems regularly and gradually gaining confidence.

So far, I‚Äôve given **4‚Äì5 rated contests** on Codeforces. My current rating is **951**, and I‚Äôm actively working to improve it with every contest.

## üéØ Upcoming Goals

- Learn and practice important topics like **Graphs**, **Trees**, and other high-frequency concepts
- Improve contest performance by solving timed, mixed-topic problem sets
- Build deeper intuition for algorithms and clean implementation strategies
- Make CP a **long-term pursuit** beyond this project

## Reflections

This project has been one of the most valuable and enjoyable learning experiences so far. I‚Äôm really enjoying competitive programming, especially because of the structure, regular practice, and support from my mentors.

> **Huge thanks to my mentors** ‚Äî they‚Äôve been super helpful and motivating throughout. Truly goated üêê!

##  Post-Midterm Progress

After the midterm, I focused deeply on **Dynamic Programming (DP)** and covered the essential foundations of **Graph Theory**. Below is a detailed summary of the concepts and problem types I explored.

---

###  Dynamic Programming (In-Depth Learning)

I explored both **Top-Down (Memoization)** and **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)** approaches, along with key principles like:

- State representation and transition design
- Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
- Space/time optimizations and one-dimensional DP

#### üìå Problems Studied
- Fibonacci sequence
- 0/1 Knapsack problem
- Coin Change (min ways and total combinations)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Edit Distance
- Path in Grid (min path sum and number of paths)
- Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm)

---

###  Graph Theory (Fundamental Concepts)

While I explored DP in detail, I also covered the fundamental aspects of Graph Theory, including:

#### ‚úÖ Topics Covered
- Graph Representations:
  - Adjacency List
  - Adjacency Matrix

- Graph Traversals:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Shortest Path Algorithms:
  - Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
  - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

- Topological Sorting:
  - Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm (BFS-based)

---

This post-midterm learning phase significantly improved my problem-solving ability in **Dynamic Programming** and gave me a solid foundation to explore **advanced Graph Algorithms**.

## üìà Problem-Solving Stats (as of now)

- ‚úÖ **100+ problems** solved on Codeforces  
- ‚úÖ **~30 problems** solved on CSES  
- ‚úÖ Plus additional problems from USACO,atcoder and shared practice sheets
