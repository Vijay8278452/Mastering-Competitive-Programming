# Mastering Competitive Programming

This repository documents my learning journey during the **SOC'25 Competitive Programming Project**, guided by my mentors. It includes my topic-wise progress, practice insights, and goals as I continue mastering the art of problem-solving.

## 🧠 Current Focus

I’m currently focused on **Dynamic Programming (DP)** — it's tough, but I know consistent effort and practice are the key to mastering it. I’m solving problems regularly and gradually gaining confidence.

So far, I’ve given **4–5 rated contests** on Codeforces. My current rating is **951**, and I’m actively working to improve it with every contest.

## 🎯 Upcoming Goals

- Learn and practice important topics like **Graphs**, **Trees**, and other high-frequency concepts
- Improve contest performance by solving timed, mixed-topic problem sets
- Build deeper intuition for algorithms and clean implementation strategies
- Make CP a **long-term pursuit** beyond this project

## Reflections

This project has been one of the most valuable and enjoyable learning experiences so far. I’m really enjoying competitive programming, especially because of the structure, regular practice, and support from my mentors.

> **Huge thanks to my mentors** — they’ve been super helpful and motivating throughout. Truly goated 🐐!
